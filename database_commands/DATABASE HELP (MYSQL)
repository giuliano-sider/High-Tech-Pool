DATABASE HELP (MYSQL)

-- invoke with
mysql -u <user> -h <host, localhost by default> -p


-- some good mysql prompt commands

show databases;

select database(); -- which is the current selected database

use <database>;

--when you have a database selected

show tables;

-- double dash comments require a space after the double dash
-- how fucked up is that ??? (that the compiler won't TELL YOU AT ALL)
